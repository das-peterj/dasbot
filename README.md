# Dasbot

Dasbot is an discord bot made with C# and DSharp. Intended to be a fun project made by Peter Jörgensen in which he explores the world of making your very own bot. It will be eventually ran on my own discord server ( https://www.discord.gg/bastion ) but at the moment of me writing this, it's only ran on a test server.
