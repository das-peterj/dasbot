# Dasbot

Dasbot is an discord bot made with C# and DSharp. Intended to be a fun project made by Peter JÃ¶rgensen in which he explores the world of making your very own bot. It's currently online 24/7 on my server https://www.discord.gg/bastion

The bot's prefix is **%** which is how you communicate with the bot. %help to see all available commands.

## Features

Webscraper

A Webscraper to pull game data from http://15650.gzidlerpg.appspot.com/web/scores?tid=220110001&guildTag=TRB and display it inside an embed on discord.

We use this in our server too compare different guilds within the game "Crush Them All".

This is relevant since there are weekly Guild-Wars where two guilds face off versus eachother and seeing how the enemy guild fare off versus your own helps with assessing the war situation.


## Applications/Software used

```java
Git
Github
Visual Studio
Discord Developer Portal
Debian
SomethingCP (Where I host the bot 24/7 and use their remote Linux terminal to operate the bot)
```
